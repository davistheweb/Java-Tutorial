## I'm taking my first Tutorial on Java, Let's see how my learning goes ðŸ™‚â†•

## What is Java?
## Java is an Object oriented programming (OOP) language, Class based, robust and secured (Java is also a platform).

## How to run a Java Program -->>.

## Download Java JDk (Java development Kit) .

## https://www.oracle.com/ng/java/technologies/downloads

## Install and make sure Environmental Variable are been register to your PC/ Mac_Os.

## Choose Your choice editor, I will recommend Vscode, Intellij Idea, Netbeans , any more choice.



## Create a folder, Create a Java file and save with the extension name (.java).

## Example (sample.java).
## Write a sample code in java.

```java
public class Code{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!"); //main() is the entrypoint of a java-program
    }
}
```
## Learn to run with Java Compiler as far as java jdk is installed into your system,
## Open command prompt and locate your file directory then run javac sample.java.

## then a "sample.class" java file will be created, This is because Java compiler runs it in bytecodes.

## Next, run java sample.java.


## NOTES:
## A Java Program should always have an access modifier.
## An access modifier is a special keyword that determines if other classes and method in java program can access a class or method.
## Access modifiers are (public,private).

## Variables.

## A variable is a memory location for a value, it can also be said as "A variable is a container that stores data".
### "int" is a keyword used to store an integer variable. 


## Types in Java:
### Java Have two types which are: Primitive and Reference.
### Primitive is used to store simple values.
### Reference is used to store complex objects.

## Category of primitive types

### 1) byte : Which takes 1 byte of memory and can store values from [-128, 127] in Range "The more byte available, "The larger number we can store"".
### 2) short : Which takes 2 bytes and can store value up to [-32k, 32k] in Range.
### 3) int : Which takes 4 bytes abd can store value up to [-2b, 2b] in Range.
### 4) long: Which takes 8 bytes. 
### byte, short, int and long are used to store number that don't have decimal point.
### to store value with decimal point, you make use of float or double.
### 5) float : Which takes 4 bytes.
### 6) double : Which takes 8 bytes.
### strings
### 7) char: Which takes 2 bytes and are used to store single character ("A","B","C".) as Range.
### 8) boolean: Which takes 1 byte of value [True/False].

## Reference Type.
## String: Which takes any amount of value
