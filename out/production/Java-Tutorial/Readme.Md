## What is Java?
# Java is an Object oriented programming (OOP) language, Class based, robust and secured (Java is also a platform)

## How to run a Java Program -->>

## Download Java JDk (Java development Kit) 

## https://www.oracle.com/ng/java/technologies/downloads/

## Install and make sure Environmental Variable are been register to your PC/ Mac_Os

## Choose Your choice editor, I will recommend Vscode, Intellij Idea, Netbeans , any more choice



## Create a folder, Create a Java file and save with the extension name (.java)

## Example (sample.java)
## Write a sample code in java

```java
public class Code{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!"); //main() is the entrypoint of a java-program
    }
}
```
## Learn to run with Java Compiler as far as java jdk is installed into your system,
## Open command prompt and locate your file directory then run javac sample.java

## then a "sample.class" java file will be created, This is because Java compiler runs it in bytecodes

## Next, run java sample.java


## NOTES:
## A Java Program should always have an access modifier 
## An access modifier is a special keyword that determines if other classes and method in java program can access a class or method
## Access modifiers are (public,private)

## Variables

## A variable is a memory location for a value, it can also be said as "A variable is a container that stores data"
### "int" is a keyword used to store an integer variable
